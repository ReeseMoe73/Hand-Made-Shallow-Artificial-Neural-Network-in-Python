# Hand-Made-Shallow-Artificial-Neural-Network-in-Python
a basic 2-layer Artificial Neural Network utilizing static backpropagation using Numpy in Python. 

A minimal NumPy-only feed-forward neural network (1 hidden layer) that learns the function “predict the next number from a pair,” e.g., [1, 2] → 3, [2, 3] → 4. The script demonstrates forward propagation, mean-squared error tracking, and vanilla backpropagation with gradient-based updates
